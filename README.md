# Adafruit_SSD1306 (64x48 fork)

**Please note: This fork exists for the sole purpose to add support for the Wemos 64x48 OLED Shield. Although I was very careful to leave everything intact I have only tested it with this particular display and can't guarantee that it will still work with other models. If you are not targeting the Wemos OLED Shield I highly recommend using the original library instead: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306**
